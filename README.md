# Medical Image Classification using Support Vector Machines

This repository contains code for a medical image classification project using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The project focuses on classifying medical images into different categories based on their findings.

## Overview

The project aims to classify medical images into various categories using a machine learning approach. It utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification tasks. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on test data.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Dataset Preparation**: 
   - Ensure you have a dataset containing medical images and corresponding labels. The images should be stored in a directory, and labels should be provided in a CSV file (`labels.csv`).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Run the provided code to preprocess the data. Adjust parameters such as image size, augmentation techniques, and batch size as needed.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train an SVM model on the preprocessed data. The model is trained using the flattened image vectors obtained after preprocessing.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on the test data to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are computed.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Make predictions on new or unseen test data using the trained SVM model.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- pandas

## Usage Example

```python
# Example code snippet demonstrating usage
# Ensure necessary imports and setup are done before executing

# Run data preprocessing
preprocess_and_save_data(image_folder, labels_file, batch_size, output_folder)

# Train the SVM model
svm_model.fit(X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], -1), y_train)

# Make predictions on test data
y_pred_test = svm_model.predict(X_test_flat)

# Evaluate model performance
accuracy_test = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy_test * 100:.2f}%")
